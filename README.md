PhoneFinger-Hands
=================

Additional .hand files for PhoneFinger, useful for making iOS demo videos by capturing the iOS Simulator.

  1. DrawnHand: an illustrated hand, showing a gray "tap" circle on mouse down;

  2. Invisible: changes the mouse cursor to a 1x1 transparent pixel, which is useful when capturing pinch/rotate action in the iOS simulator since it draws its own gray touch circles.

Installation

  * Clone into ~/Library/Application\ Support/PhoneFinger/Hands

  * Launch PhoneFinger 

  * You should now see "Drawn Hand" and "Invisible" options under the Hand / Model selection pulldown.
